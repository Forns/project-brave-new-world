## An Exploration of Autonomy vs Central Authority in Robotic Asteroid Mining

=======================

Humans are utilizing the Earth’s non-renewable resources at a rate which will deplete the Earth of all resources within one century (Swain, McCandless, Zagami, Quick, 2012). Mankind’s expedited consumption of the Earth’s resources has led to their testing other celestial bodies with the hope of finding similar resources (Nelson, Britt, Lebofsky, 1993). After extensive testing, researchers found C-Type asteroids containing Pyroxene and signs of water and S-Type asteroids containing Nickel-Iron and Pyroxene (Shaw, 2012). Scientists can produce several resources by combining or separating the elements found in these asteroids, thus increasing the possibility of mining both C-Type and S-Type asteroids (Deer, Howie, Zussman, 1992). As such, the need for efficient, automated resource harvesting tactics will be of interest in the near future.

The current study seeks to achieve the following goals:

Design robotic animats that use learned environmental association cues and memory to quickly find resources of interest.
Determine which, between autonomy and central control, is the paradigm in a communication-inhibited environment.
Observe robotic animats’ choices of roles in the mining operation to see if division of labor is learned.
