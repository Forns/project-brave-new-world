## An Exploration of Robotic Scouting and Communication Techniques in Swarm vs SearchParty Paradigms

=======================

With SpaceX sitting on the horizon of human development, effective techniques for exploring, 
assessing, and even populating distant planets will be required to advance scientific 
understanding of the universe. In the case of colonization, it is plausible to imagine that robotic 
intervention may be necessary to prepare a planet for human inhabitants. The present study 
seeks to explore the explorers by ranking various robotic scouting techniques on efficiency 
(speed of finding vital resources) and robustness (finding resources before running out of power 
or breaking down) in a communication and visibility inhibited environment.

**Hypotheses:** Communicating searchparties of scouts will be able to find resources of interest 
more quickly than swarms due to deadend path pruning from more efficient associative 
learning. Swarms may be similarly successful if their home base is capable of data storage.

**Goal:** Successfully discover vital resources on the planet’s surface including water, minerals, and soil.

**Metric:** How quickly vital resources are discovered and what effect the environment, communication, 
and grouping techniques have on the speed of discovery, if any.
